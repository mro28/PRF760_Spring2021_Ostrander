			<h1>Michael Ostrander's Website!</h1>
			<p>Thanks for stopping by! This website was created by me, Michael Ostrander, using HTML, Javascript, CSS, and JQuery. This website is a way for me to communicate anything you might want to know about me. Included is my professional interests, qualities, and goals, as well as personal information and activities of note. My primary goal is to further develop myself both as a leader and technical professional. This can be accomplished through networking with like-minded individuals, or finding a career that challenges me. By challenging myself, I open myself to becoming a better person, and grow into better contributors to society. Without these challenges, we would never have discovered the sun being the center of the solar system, or reached the new world, or set foot on the moon. From this growth we find purpose, and in this purpose we enrich both ourselves and those around us.</p>

			<p>• Implemented a cryptographically strong file sharing application using the BouncyCastle API. The threat model consisted ofthe basic assumptions that clients and File Servers were not to be trusted. These attacks could be carried out passively oractively.<br />• Mitigation techniques included session keys created through a Diffie-Hellman exchange, RSA signed tokens to prove client identity, AES encrypted traffic to prevent passive monitoring, SHA-256 HMAC to prevent replay attacks, and login limiting to prevent Denial of Service attacks.</p>

				<p>Hi, my name is Michael. When I'm not working to earn my Master’s degree in Cybersecurity or working at Bettis Naval Nuclear Laboratory, I enjoy cooking exotic dishes, spending (socially distanced) time with friends and family, travelling, and playing soccer. On the right is a picture I took of the Grand Square in Brussels, Belgium, which was built in the 13th century. I also enjoy volunteering part time as a tutor. It is part of my moral philosophy that we give back to the community in what ways we can, and for me that comes in the form of technical acumen and teaching skills. This is not a complete selfless act though. It also teaches me by reinforcing building-block technical concepts, and more importantly improving my leadership abilities. Leadership is not a skill that can be understated. Leadership skills are used at the very top and very bottom of every organization. We lead our families. We lead in times of recreation, like in sports. </p>

				<p>One leadership story that particularly resonated with me came from my favorite Soccer team, Newcastle United. They were in a downward spiral and it looked as though being kicked out of the top league was inevitable. That was until a new team captain stepped forward, Jamaal Lascelles, who inspired his team. Not through his ability, but his message of unity, that together the skid could be stopped. And he was right. The team was able to pull it together and finished in a position higher than anyone thought possible. The end of the season came with an unexpected win, and the resulting euphoria can be seen pictured on the left. Through perseverance and a belief that things can and will get better, leadership can be the difference maker. I can only strive to be that difference maker, both professionally and personally.</p>
