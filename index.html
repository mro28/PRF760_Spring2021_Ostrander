			<h1>Michael Ostranders Website</h1>
			<p>Thanks for stopping by! This website was created by me, Michael Ostrander, using HTML, Javascript, CSS, and JQuery. Most of the information I learned in school, but some of it needed to brushed up on and others, such as JQuery, had to be learned completely new. Fortunately, web libraries these days are getting easier and easier to use, making it no problem at all. With only 40 or so lines of JQuery script, I was able to implement the tabbing functionality up top (Home / Resume / About Me / Contact). If I were to only use Javascript, it would have taken much, much more and would have been that much more complicated. Other than that, basic CSS was used for the colors and text customization, and HTML was the underlying backbone of the layout and flow. If you would like more information on this site and how it was made, just ask!</p>

			<p>Cryptographically Secure File Sharing Application (Java) – Team member of three&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; January – April 2016</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "resumetextlong">
			<p>• Implemented a cryptographically strong file sharing application using the BouncyCastle API. The threat model consisted ofthe basic assumptions that clients and File Servers were not to be trusted. These attacks could be carried out passively oractively.<br />• Mitigation techniques included session keys created through a Diffie-Hellman exchange, RSA signed tokens to prove client identity, AES encrypted traffic to prevent passive monitoring, SHA-256 HMAC to prevent replay attacks, and login limiting to prevent Denial of Service attacks.</p>

			<p>• Used Logisim, a virtual logic circuit program, to construct a CPU that could read in basic assembly instructions and convert them into machine code, which were then processed in a useful manner. Instructions included arithmetic, pointer manipulation, and memory operations. This required designing an ALU, a Control Signal Unit, a PC incrementor, as well as Register and Memory Operation modules.</p>

				<p>Hi, my name is Michael. I like soccer, coding, food, video games, and hanging out with my friends. My favorite soccer team is Newcastle United, who currently play in the English Premier League. You can see them pictured on the left. Currently my favorite video game is Rainbow Six: Siege, but I have a new favorite basically every other day. When I have time, I like to play soccer with some friends, especially now that Winter is finally over. I also enjoy swimming, playing with pets, and going for long walks on the beach. I'm also minorly addicted to chocolate. If you make a plate of chocolate chip cookes, don't be surprised if I eat all of them. I have visited two other countries, Ireland and Belgium. You can see the Grand Place in Brussels, Belgium pictured on the right. It was a city square originally built in the 13th century. That's some 800 years ago! Ireland is great too, they have great food, places to visit, and I think I also might have seen a leprechaun!</p>

				<p>My favorite thing about coding is the freedom of possibilites. With code, you literally can make anything you can think of. Our world is continually getting more wired, and with it come more opportunities for people to do the wiring. Much of our favorite applications and webpages were created by someone who sat down and thought, "Hmm, you know what would be cool? ..." With code, possibilities are literally endless, and that's a powerful tool.</p>
